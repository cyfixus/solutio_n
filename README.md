Early development of SOLUTIO_N

A company has developed a SOLUTIO_N to our nuclear waste problem... but during the groundbreaking demonstration, a roach managed to sneak in and cover itself with SOLUTIO_N and escape before the capsule was closed.
You play a lab technician who is armed with a nuclear waste gun. 
Cover the walls and floors with waste in order to attract the SOLUTIO_N soaked roach into the capsule.
Dispense the waste wisely, the presence of waste will quickly deplete your life.
Remember, the lab walls are designed to absorb nuclear waste.
